# fp-interpreter-in-lisp

An interpreter for Backus's FP programming language.

FP (short for Function Programming) is a programming language created by John Backus to support the function-level programming paradigm. This allows eliminating named variables.

The interpreter reads, parses and evaluates FP expressions, such as function definitions, and application of an environment to a function.

This project was created for academic and educational purposes only.
